I really cant be bothered to actually optimize this shit, I know I shouldn't calculate each pixel but who can say no to saving time. As an engineer, I firmly believe that saving time is more important than saving runtime in many cases. There are several reasons for this but mainly. Optimizing runtime by reducing algorithmic complexity or improving hardware performance can require significant investments in resources and time. While these measures may improve runtime, they may not always be justifiable in terms of cost and benefit. Therefore, prioritizing time-saving measures can help me balance efficiency with practicality and maximize my productivity.
